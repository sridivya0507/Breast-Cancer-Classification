# 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** to classify tumors as **Malignant** or **Benign** based on 30 numerical features extracted from cell nucleus images.

The project includes:

### 🔍 **1. Exploratory Data Analysis**

* Understanding feature distributions
* Correlation analysis
* Visualizing relationships between features
* Investigating class balance

### 🤖 **2. Model Development**

* Trained a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** using default parameters
* Achieved strong baseline accuracy *without* any tuning
* Evaluated model performance using:

  * Confusion Matrix
  * Accuracy Score
  * Precision, Recall & F1-score

### 🧪 **3. Why This Project Matters**

Machine Learning plays an increasingly important role in healthcare by assisting clinicians with:

* Early disease detection
* Identifying hidden patterns in medical data
* Supporting faster and more reliable diagnosis

This dataset provides a great opportunity to demonstrate how even classical ML algorithms can contribute to medical decision-support systems.
